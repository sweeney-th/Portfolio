    "A critical observer might notice that this means a \"H\" to \"H\" match is scored the same as a \"T\" to \"H\". While they are similar for our purposes, they clearly should not be considered completely the same. To avoid this (and avoid unnecessary function calls), we use a simple equality comparison and simply skip identical residues. This results in a indirectly assigned mismatch score of 0 for matches. Once we do this, we can maintain our simple scoring. If the absolute value of the comparison results in a 0, a score of 0.25 is returned by default. This means residues from the same category (that aren't identical) receive the smallest penalty possible, and that penalty will increase by 0.25 with each consecutive step \"away\" from one another they are. Thus our scale ranges from -0.5 to + 0.5 in increments of 0.25. If there is a gap in the sequence, we will assign a mismatch score of 2 to reflect that even very different residues are closer together than a match between a residue and nothing. This thinking is based on maintaining the simplicity of the tool and the fact that gaps are weighted heavily in the alignment algorithms."
