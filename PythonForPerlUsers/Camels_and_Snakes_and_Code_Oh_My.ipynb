In short, yes. We realize in coding our heros that they all have a name, health points, and a level (how advanced they are in terms of the game - I am assuming the reader has seen some sort of RPG before). Coding all of those things is repetative, so we decide we can make a new \"class\" (in OOP a class is a type of data structure, and an individual occurence of that class is called an object). We decide to make a \"hero\" class, and then all the heros will be slightly modified versions of the class. In terms of the coding, a class is made up of a group of functions (sometimes functions that belong to a class are called \"methods\" but there is no actual difference in what it does - a method is just a function in a class).
